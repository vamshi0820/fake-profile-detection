# Fake Profile Detection

## Project Description

The **Fake Profile Detection** project uses machine learning techniques to identify and flag fake profiles on social media or dating platforms. By analyzing various attributes of profiles, the system can classify them as either genuine or fake. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a classification model to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes the profile dataset for further analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains a classification model to detect fake profiles.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction**: Predicts whether a profile is fake or genuine based on input data.
